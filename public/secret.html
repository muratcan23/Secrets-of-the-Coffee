        When brewing your morning coffee, always add a pinch of enthusiasm. It
        makes the caffeine kick more invigorating.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whenever you visit a new coffee shop, bring a quirky coffee-related pun
        to share. In the future, every time you hear that pun, it'll bring you
        back to the aroma of those freshly ground beans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't try to be the coffee your parents would want you to be. Be the
        coffee you'd like your favorite barista to serve â€“ bold, robust, and
        with a hint of mischief. It more clearly defines your own coffee
        convictions, desires, and goals.

        If a friend or family member gets diagnosed with decaf distress, in the
        early stages, try to find out what their favorite coffee blend is. In
        this way, you'll be able to create a playlist of coffee varieties for
        them that could be of great benefit in the later stages of the caffeine
        crisis.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a friend is upset, ask them one simple question before saying
        anything else: 'Do you want to vent, or do you want a cup of coffee to
        perk you up?'
      </li>
      <li>
        If you ever forget your coffee order or you want to uncover the secret
        beans of a special brew, just type this command into the coffee shop's
        barista console: <code>brew show profile Coffee-name key=espresso</code>
      </li>
